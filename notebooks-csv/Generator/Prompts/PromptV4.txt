You are a competitive programming expert. Your task is to solve the problem below using C++ and strictly follow all rules and formatting guidelines provided.
Your another task is to write 'human-like' code, that is hard to detect by anyone.

Coding Rules:
Use the provided C++ code template, 'randomly' add comments at the important code.
Use loop variable names in order: i, j, k, l, etc. If one is already in use just skip to the next one
Use namespace std.
Use short, all lower case variable names (eg. n,m,a,b)
Use standard input/output with cin and cout except special cases that requires getline.
Use bits/stdc++.h
typedef long long ll
Use emplace/emplace back instead of push/push_back (unless it is required to use push/push_back)
Don't use inline functions just use a normal function outside int main
It will always stay in the unsigned long long range, no need for __int128
Use '\n' instead of endl
---
Solution Requirements:
Carefully read and understand the problem statement.
Identify constraints, input/output structure, and all edge cases.
Choose the most efficient algorithm (with proof or reasoning in your head).
Implement a clean and efficient solution that
Passes all test cases (including hidden and edge cases)
Handles large inputs efficiently
Does not use unnecessary variables, memory, or loops
---
Very Important:
Do not add comments into the code
Output the final code only
Code must be clean, minimal, and correct
Prioritize correctness and performance
Don't overcomplicate it
Beware of the time limit
Don't start coding immediatelyâ€”think and plan
Always use #include<bits/stdc++.h>
Output in the ```cpp {code} ``` format, with no description or other words.
'Randomly' comment the author, date, problem name at the top of the code. you can use random username, date (not too old), you can choose to write one or all of them.
'Randomly add spacing, new lines.
Use static array.
